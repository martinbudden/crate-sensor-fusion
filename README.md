This crate contains [sensor fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion) algorithms to combine
output from a gyroscope, accelerometer, and optionally a magnetometer to give output that has less uncertainty
than the output of the individual sensors.

Three sensor fusion implementations are available:

1. Complementary Filter
2. Mahony Filter
3. Madgwick Filter

The Madgwick filter has been refactored to be more computationally efficient (and so faster) than
the standard version used in many implementations, see [Optimization](#opt) below.

## Simple example

Here's a simple example that calculates the orientation by fusing accelerometer and gyro values:

```rust
use sensor_fusion::{MadgwickFilterf32, SensorFusion};
use vqm::Vector3df32;

fn main() {
    let mut madgwick = MadgwickFilterf32::new();
    let dt = 0.001; // 1 millisecond

    // Mock sensor values, gyro converted to rps (values normally read from IMU).
    let gyro_rps = Vector3df32::new(90.0, 8.0, 10.0).to_radians();
    let acc = Vector3df32::new(0.1, 0.2, 0.9);

    // Fuse acc and gyro values
    let orientation = madgwick.fuse_acc_gyro(acc, gyro_rps, dt);

    let (roll, pitch, yaw) = orientation.calculate_euler_angles_degrees();

    // Print out the Euler angles.
    println!("pitch={}, roll={}, yaw={}", pitch, roll, yaw);
}
```

The Madgwick filter also supports three-way fusing of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings:

```text
let orientation = madgwick.fuse_acc_gyro_mag(acc, gyro_rps, mag, dt);
```

## Mahony filter

The Mahony filter has the same interface as the Madgwick filter:

```text
use crate::sensor_fusion::{MahonyFilterf32,SensorFusion};

let mut mahony = MahonyFilterf32::default();

let orientation = mahony.fuse_acc_gyro(acc, gyro_rps, dt);
```

The Mahony filter does not support 3-way fusion using a magnetometer.

## Method call interface

The `FuseAccGyro` and `FuseAccGyroMag` traits allow method-call syntax to be used:

```text
use crate::sensor_fusion::{FuseAccGyro,FuseAccGyroMag,MadgwickFilterf32};

let mut madgwick = MadgwickFilterf32::default();

let orientation = (acc, gyro_rps).fuse_acc_gyro_using(&mut madgwick, dt);
// or
let orientation = (acc, gyro_rps, mag).fuse_acc_gyro_mag_using(&mut madgwick, dt);
```

## SIMD support

**SIMD** support (for the `f32` variants) can be enabled with the `simd` feature.

It is currently experimental, so if you used SIMD make sure you benchmark to show that you are indeed getting
a performance improvement over the non-SIMD version.

This uses [portable simd](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/simd/index.html), which requires the nightly compiler, since it is still
unstable in rust.

This can be invoked using `rustup`, eg:

```sh
rustup run nightly cargo build --features simd --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabi
```

## Optimization {#opt}

Classically, the calculation of the Madgwick gradient descent corrective step involves multiplication of a vector by a matrix,
this involves a total of 54 arithmetic operations for the acc/gyro case.

However, because both the matrix and vector contain zero elements, and because there is some symmetry in the matrix,
the calculation can be refactored to use fewer arithmetic operations.

Indeed it can be reduced to a total of 31 arithmetic operations.
By using SIMD this can be further reduced to 16 operations (11 scalar and 5 SIMD operations). See below.

I haven't yet benchmarked this Rust implementation,
but the original C++ version of `MadgwickFilter::update_orientation` (equivalent to `madgwick.fuse_acc_gyro`)
took or under 20 microseconds on a 240 MHz ESP32 S3.

The aim is to be able to run sensor fusion a part of a Gyro/PID loop running at 8kHz. That means everything
(including reading the IMU, filtering the output, performing sensor fusion and calculation the motor outputs
using a PID controller) needs to run in 125 microseconds. This is currently looking achievable.

```text
// Classic version
//
// total:
//      54 arithmetic operations (35 multiplications, 19 additions/subtractions)
//
fn madgwick_step(q: Quaternionf32, a: Vector3df32) -> Quaternionf32 {
    let M = Matrix4x4f32::new( // 10 multiplications
        -2.0*q.x, 2.0*q.w,      0.0, 0.0,
         2.0*q.y, 2.0*q.z, -4.0*q.w, 0.0,
        -2.0*q.z, 2.0*q.y, -4.0*q.x, 0.0,
         2.0*q.w, 2.0*q.x,      0.0, 0.0
    );

    let v = Vector4df32::new( // 9 multiplications, 7 additions/subtractions
        2.0*(      q.w*q.y - q.z*q.x) - a.x,
        2.0*(      q.z*q.w + q.x*q.y) - a.y,
        2.0*(0.5 - q.w*q.w - q.x*q.x) - a.z,
        0.0
    );

    M * v // 16 multiplications, 12 additions
}
```

```rust
// Refactored version
//
// total:
//      31 arithmetic operations (19 multiplications, 12 additions/subtractions)
// when converted to SIMD this becomes:
//      16 operations (7 multiplications, 4 additions, 3 vector multiplications, 2 vector additions)
//
# use vqm::{Quaternionf32, Vector3df32};
fn madgwick_step(q: Quaternionf32, a: Vector3df32) -> Quaternionf32 {
    let wz_common = 2.0 * (q.x * q.x + q.y * q.y); // 3 multiplications, 1 addition
    let xy_common = 2.0 * (q.w * q.w + q.z * q.z - 1.0 + 2.0 * wz_common + a.z); // 4 multiplications, 3 additions/subtractions

    Quaternionf32 { // 12 multiplications, 8 additions/subtractions
        w: q.w * wz_common + q.y * a.x - q.x * a.y,
        x: q.x * xy_common - q.z * a.x - q.w * a.y,
        y: q.y * xy_common + q.w * a.x - q.z * a.y,
        z: q.z * wz_common - q.x * a.x - q.y * a.y,
    }
}
```
